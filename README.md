# Bootcamp2 autograder
This is to allow students to verify that their code passes the automated tests.  The tests could certainly be more robust.

To run the tests COPY your files into this directory and use test_indv.sh:

    bash test_indv.sh

# WARNING:
The batch test deletes files, renamed to test_deletesFILES, it is meant to be run from a separate directory!  It will automatically copy your code over to this directory and remove the files after.
